## 1.1.0 (2016-05-28)

triggered scroll animation should be interrutible or not. A page wide 
default can be specified using `PageScrollConfig.defaultInterruptible`.

save resources (fixes #9)
- Overshooting target when large distance to scroll and short scroll animation 
duration (fixes #7)
- body.scrollTop not working on non-Blink based browser like Firefox and IE 
(thanks to [bensgroi](https://github.com/bensgroi), #10)

scroll target is not found or already reached (previously it did not stop).
